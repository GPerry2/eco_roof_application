<h3>1. Administration</h3>
<p>The Eco-Roof Incentive Program ("the Program") will be administered by the Environment and Energy Office of the City
  of Toronto ("the City") with the support of the following City Divisions during the review of applications: Toronto
  Water, City Planning and Toronto Building.</p>
<h3>2. Application Criteria</h3>
<p>An Eco-Roof is defined as a cool roof or a green roof as per the eligibility criteria described in section 4.
  Projects must be above grade (parking garages and at-grade roofs are ineligible), scheduled for completion within 6
  months of notification of funding approval and must be one of the following to apply for the Eco-Roof Incentive
  Program:</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li type="i">a green roof or cool roof retrofit project on an existing residential, industrial, commercial or
    institutional building.
  </li>
  <li type="i">a green roof or cool roof project on a new residential, industrial, institutional or commercial building
    with a GFA of less than 2,000 m2 (21,528 sq ft).
  </li>
  <li type="i">a green roof on a new construction project (of any size) by Public, French or Catholic School Boards</li>
  <li type="i">a green roof on a new construction project (of any size) by an organization incorporated as a

  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Cool or green roof projects that are already complete are not eligible for funding. Priority will be given to
  buildings within an employment district in Map 2 of the Toronto Official Plan.</p>
<h3>3. Selection of Participants</h3>
<p>The City wishes to make financial incentives available under this Program on a fair basis to a broad range of
  eligible applicants and, for this purpose, the City reserves the absolute right to limit the approval of applications
  and/or funds granted in such a manner as to ensure no single applicant or property owner receives a disproportionate
  share of Program funds, notwithstanding there may be available Program funds or that all funding eligibility
  requirements have been met by the Applicant. By accepting these terms of reference, the Applicant acknowledges and
  agrees that the selection and approval of an application for a Program grant is in the absolute discretion of the
  City, and that the City has reserved rights to limit the number of grants approved and the manner of grant approval on
  such grounds and conditions as it deems in the best interests of the public. Without limiting the foregoing, where the
  number of eligible grant applications received exceeds available program funding, the Director of the Environment and
  Energy Division shall have the absolute discretion in the selection and approval of applications subject to such
  selection criteria as may be established by City Council.</p>

  </li>
</ol>
<h5>4.1.1 Green Roof - Structural Assessment Grant Guidelines</h5>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
  <li> Purpose: To help offset the cost of a structural assessment to determine whether or not an existing
    building can carry the additional load of a green roof.
  </li>
  <li> Amount: The SAG amount is either the actual cost of the structural assessment or $1000, whichever is
    less.
  </li>
  <li> Required documentation: To be considered for SAG funding, applicants planning to install a green roof
    must submit the following:
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li type="i"> A copy of the structural assessment report that evaluates the ability of a building to hold the weight
      of a green roof that meets the requirements of the Green Roof Construction Standards.
    </li>
    <li type="i"> A copy of the paid invoice for the structural assessment</li>
  </ol>
  These two supporting documents must be submitted with Eco-Roof Incentive Program application before the green roof is
  installed.
  <li> Process if proceeding with green roof: After the green roof has been approved, completed and verified by
    City of Toronto program staff, the SAG amount will be added to the final green roof grant payment and dispersed as
    one total amount:
    <p>SAG amount + Green roof incentive amount = Total grant amount</p></li>
  <li> Process if not proceeding with green roof: If the structural engineer determines that the building
    cannot support the additional load of a green roof, the applicant is not required to install a green roof, but is
    still eligible for SAG funding. The applicant will qualify for the SAG as long as the following documents are
    received:
    <ol>
      <li type="i"> A copy of the structural assessment report (the report must state that the building cannot support
        the additional load of a green roof)
      </li>
      <li type="i"> A copy of the paid invoice for the structural assessment</li>
    </ol>
  <li> Qualified professionals: Property owners may choose any structural engineer licensed to work in the
    Province of Ontario.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>4.2 Cool Roof Specifications</h4>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
  <li>“Cool Roof” means a roofing system with high solar reflectivity and thermal emissivity to reduce the
    urban heat island effect and can be either a coating applied over an existing roof system or a new single-ply
    waterproofing membrane that meets the performance specifications outlined below.
  </li>
  <li> To be eligible for participation in this Program and the Cool Roof incentive, each applicant must
    demonstrate that the proposed Cool Roof:
    <ol>
      <li type="i"> will have an area that covers 100% of the roof area of the building, excluding mechanical equipment
        or other environmental technologies (which can be achieved through multiple partial roof retrofits to eventually
        equal 100% coverage).
      </li>
      <li type="i"> will be comprised of a roof material or coating system that:
        <ol class="right-parenthesis">
          <li> has a minimum Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) rating of 78 for low sloped roofs. Low sloped roofs have a
            surface slope less than 16.7% (9.5 degrees).
          </li>
          <li> has a minimum SRI of 29 for steep slope roofs. Steep sloped roofs have a surface slope greater than 16.7%
            (9.5 degrees) and less than 41.7% (22.6 degrees).
          </li>
          <li> has an emissivity greater than 0.9 and an initial solar reflectance of 0.65 (equivalent to an SRI of
            78).
          </li>
          <li> is asbestos and mercury-free and emits zero volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone depleting
            substances (ODSs).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
